# Week 3
Write a program (ArrayDemo.java) that prompts the user to enter 5 integer numbers.  Once the user enters the 5 numbers, the program must determine and output the average, the largest, and smallest of 5 numbers.

Use the lecture slides and the example videos as a guide to complete this assignment. Use the Scanner class as shown in the video of the Arrays module to read user input from the terminal window.

You must define the methods listed below in your program.  Make sure to keep the keyword "static" when you define the methods (we will learn later what static means). Call these methods from the "main" to get the job done.
