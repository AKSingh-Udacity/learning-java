# Week 2
Write a java program with the class name "StudentGrade" that generates a random number between 50 and 100 for a student grade and determines the letter grade of the student. The student grade is determined based on the following criteria:

90-100               A

80-89                 B

70-79                 C

60-69                 D

Less than 60      F

In your program, you can use the following statement to generate a random number between 50 and 100

int grade = (int)(Math.random() * 50) + 50;

 

Use a loop to to generate 5 random grades and output the letter grade for each. The output of your program should be similar to:

Student grade is 73 which is C.

Student grade is 52 which is F.

Student grade is 90 which is A.

Student grade is 88 which is B.

Student grade is 82 which is B.
